# THis is the new README

### This did not work from the 1st time
__Reasons__:
What I did at first: _git pull_. But I was in the branch _AlexYama1/edit_. $$\rightarrow$$ Nowhere to pull from. You can do _git pull_, when you are on the _main_ branch.

__Correct version__:
1. _git pull origin main_ - Go to my GitHub repo (called origin) and get the updates from the main branch
